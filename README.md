Problem Statement
Rainfall is a crucial climatic factor that affects agriculture, water supply, and disaster preparedness. In this project, we:
Analyze historical weather data.
Build a Linear Regression model to predict rainfall (precipitation).
Evaluate the model's performance.


🧠 Key Features
Data Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Selection
Linear Regression Model
Model Evaluation using R² Score and RMSE
Visualizations (scatter plots, reg plots, heatmaps)


📚 Dataset
Source: Austin Weather Dataset
Format: CSV
Features may include:
Date
Temperature (High, Low, Average)
Humidity
Wind Speed
Precipitation (Rainfall in inches)


⚙️ Technologies Used
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn (LinearRegression)
Sample Visualizations
Correlation Heatmap
Scatter Plot of Rainfall vs Temperature
Regression Plot of Predicted vs Actual Rainfall


✅ Output
The model outputs:
Predicted rainfall based on input weather parameters.
Model accuracy using metrics such as R² score and RMSE
